Business Question 

1. Question: Which structure reported the maximum monthly fuel oil consumption?
SELECT building_name, fuel_Oil_usage_mmbtu
FROM consumption
ORDER BY fuel_Oil_usage_mmbtu DESC
LIMIT 1;

2. Question: Can we ascertain the cumulative fuel oil consumption for each borough?
SELECT borough, SUM(fuel_Oil_usage_mmbtu) AS Total_Fuel_Usage
FROM consumption
GROUP BY borough
ORDER BY Total_Fuel_Usage DESC;

3. Question: In each borough, how many structures reported zero fuel oil consumption?
SELECT borough, COUNT(*) AS Buildings_with_Zero_Usage
FROM consumption
WHERE fuel_Oil_usage_mmbtu = 0
GROUP BY borough;

4. Question: What is the mean fuel oil consumption for structures located in Manhattan?
SELECT AVG(fuel_Oil_usage_mmbtu) AS Average_Fuel_Usage
FROM consumption
WHERE borough = 'Manhattan';
